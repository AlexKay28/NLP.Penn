__label__0	going off of olanzapine is no picnic.  you have to be prepared to ask the aid of the gods, jesus, krishna.
__label__1	i really hate the fact that i feel like i need to throw up while at work. maybe taking my vyvanse wasn't a good idea
__label__1	almost blew out my arms &amp; heels @ work. they hurt like hell. &amp; the pain is spreading, damned cipro.
__label__0	in the 60's people took acid to make the world weird. now, the world is weird and people take prozac to make it normal.
__label__0	@msprettystrains i mean i'm all for legalizing i'm just saying taking something legal is easier but i take my vyvanse&amp;smoke weed  #legalize
__label__0	@signandsight nice. i just got 6 months of vimpat the other day, didn't cost a dime!
__label__0	generics combo non-inferior to treatment with enbrel! read the whole story at generics and biologicals initiative gabi
__label__0	gawd i missed taking my cymbalta last nite...not good;p   running to drug store fast!
__label__0	so based on the commercial i just watched, cymbalta helps if it doesn't kill you first. depression isn't the only thing that hurts.
__label__0	mama threw out my old seroquel~ greg: has yo mama lost her damn mind! go get it outta the trash! imma sell dat shit!
__label__0	@niallofficial get a throat lozenge
__label__0	@702johnrobbie cipro website was 100 times better than the new cipc website. nothing works properly on cipc

__label__0	@jesusislana @ewdustin -generic drugs as effective as amgen's enbrel for arthritis- @fiinging -: a blockbuster drug made b...  @anorexic0
__label__0	i tried to think of the cold rain as a minty lozenge for the skin but it didn't work and now if you're not careful i will cry on you.
__label__0	@theellenshow hey ellen, dis b da pappy from angie la. it means dat they need a big prozac to chill out da whole dang city !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0	@sillysubmissive i am so sorry. *gives you cranberry juice, morphine, and ciprofloxacin*

__label__0	i have #humira -exp. date june2013..is it still safe to use these this month?? other meds i‚Äôve used after exp. but w/ biologic? #rheum #help
__label__0	@nixawaterspirit i recently had my venlafaxine dosage raised and i think that could be why but side effects come and go
__label__0	@alcritchleyy @epilepsyaction am an lamotrigine av bin for long time is the levetricetan beta?
__label__0	thin lozenge stiff, acer 4820tg main features in regard to valorous exceptional playacting
__label__0	i need cymbalta
__label__0	alright i can't stand to look at anything to do with paroxetine, heart defect, odds ratios or confidence intervals for the rest of the night
__label__0	"@nurse_problems ""do you have high blood pressure and diabetes?"" pt says no but they are on metoprolol and glimepiride....."
__label__0	would you slow down? you sound like the end of a cymbalta commercial. #arresteddevelopment #hbic
__label__0	i cant believe i juked mr.zometa in soccer ;o lol
__label__0	@sailorcliff just took a trazodone..incase i fall asleep while tweeting i'll say love ya n sweet dreams...that stuff hits me hard lol
__label__1	@agentmariahill i've taken the bp daily if not twice a day like i should, it's juz i didn't think the effexor would spike it so. i'm usually
__label__1	starting humira tomorrow. :) i wonder if it will make me tired for a day or so like remicade did. if it works, it's worth it.
__label__1	@anyssiakaissa depakote made me feel flat, but helps many. zyprexa can cause weight gain, so be very careful. i can't tolerate it.
__label__0	@themccuntface all the effort and passion in the world is nt enough. paxil patients r suffering from a giant hole ripped in their soul.
__label__1	i have put on weight (thanks ms and #tysabri). always look on the bright side: time for a @thinkgeek t-shirt spree! #winning
__label__0	i do not understand how people prefer vyvanse over adderall.
__label__0	has anyone else been on venlafaxine/effexor? i'm on it now and i have shitty side affects with it
__label__0	lackin of nicotine
__label__0	@courtney my psych dropped after an insurance change so iam coming off cymbalta, adderall, klonopin, mirtazapine and gabapentin
__label__0	effexor pphn lawsuit filed over failure to warn about pregnancy risks #effexor #news #antidepressant
__label__0	zyprexa relprevv just killed two people according to @wsj #cannabis never killed anyone
__label__0	just heard a great debate on #remicade from #ddw but now im just more unsure if i should stay on #humira... #crohnsproblems
__label__0	also unclear if memantine is helpful at this point. #autismchat
__label__0	@lithiumlibgirl i'm sure it helps that you are so active. i did eventually lose my olanzapine lbs, so there is hope. :)
__label__0	‚Äú@uberfacts: bananas contain a natural chemical that can make a person happy - same chemical found in prozac.‚Äù i love bananas @olliejcohen
__label__0	depression hurts, cymbalta can help
__label__1	hey not sleeping. #hotflashes #menopause #effexor
__label__0	"i believe it ""@_ramossssss: did you know twitter is as addicting as nicotine ?"""
__label__0	keep yo black n milds, cuz me no nicotine.
__label__0	"@britni_baker your vyvanse... ""dude hold up don't move them i wanna take a picture and set it as my background"""
__label__0	i take vyvanse and continuously listen to vocal trance mixes
__label__0	cough drops are mostly loaded with sugar. so after soothing your throat with a lozenge, be sure to brush well!
__label__0	@demyelinatindan &gt;funny blog dan. currently taking avonex, but considering taking tysabri soon, also given the option of taking those pills.
